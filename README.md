## Purpose
I've started this [project](https://github.com/thejahweh/jahweh.ch) 
to challenge [myself](https://github.com/thejahweh) and learn new things.
It is a game because I never made any games and wanted to do something new.

## Gameplay
The game is playable online on my website https://jahweh.ch

### Territories
Ascending fields are grouped to a territory. Each territory has one main building.

### Units
Each unit is defending the neighboring field from the same player.
A unit has a defined strength and can only capture other fields with a weaker defending strength.
